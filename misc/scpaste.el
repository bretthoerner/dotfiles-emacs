;;; Commentary:

;; This will place an HTML copy of a buffer on the web on a server
;; that the user has shell access on.

;; It's similar in purpose to services such as http://paste.lisp.org
;; or http://rafb.net, but it's much simpler since it assumes the user
;; has an account on a publicly-accessible HTTP server. It uses `scp'
;; as its transport and uses Emacs' font-lock as its syntax
;; highlighter instead of relying on a third-party syntax highlighter
;; for which individual language support must be added one-by-one.

;; It has been tested in Emacs 23, but it should work in 22.

;;; Install

;; To install, copy this file into your Emacs source directory, set
;; `scpaste-http-destination' and `scpaste-scp-destination' to
;; appropriate values, and add this to your .emacs file:

;; (autoload 'scpaste "scpaste" "Paste the current buffer." t nil)

;;; Usage

;; M-x scpaste, enter a name, and press return. The name will be
;; incorporated into the URL by escaping it and adding it to the end
;; of `scpaste-http-destination'. The URL for the pasted file will be
;; pushed onto the kill ring.

;; You can autogenerate a splash page that gets uploaded as index.html
;; in `scpaste-http-destination' by invoking M-x scpaste-index. This
;; will upload an explanation as well as a listing of existing
;; pastes. If a paste's filename includes "private" it will be skipped.

;; You probably want to set up SSH keys for your destination to avoid
;; having to enter your password once for each paste. Also be sure the
;; key of the host referenced in `scpaste-scp-destination' is in your
;; known hosts file--scpaste will not prompt you to add it but will
;; simply hang.

;;; Todo:

;; Make htmlize convert all URLs to hyperlinks
